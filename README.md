[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b3c05031-f810-4e38-8f83-55cc572c604e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lmpsk/deploys)
My personal portfolio built using GatsbyJS static site generator, thus it is written in React. You can visit live site here: [lmpsk.me](https://lmpsk.me/) 

Site is deployed on netlify and sources projects from google sheets just for convenience sake, because I use them quite often.
